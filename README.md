# Smart TODO List

A smart, auto-categorizing todo list app. The user simply has to add the name of the thing, and it gets put into the correct list.

## Project Setup

1. Create your own empty repo on GitHub, ideally using the name of your project
2. Clone this repository (<mark>do not fork!</mark>)

- When cloning, specify a different folder name that is relevant to your project

3. Remove the git remote: `git remote rm origin`
4. Add a remote for your origin: `git remote add origin <your github repo URL>`
5. Push to the new origin: `git push -u origin master`
6. Verify that the skeleton code now shows up in your repo on GitHub

## Getting Started

- Install all dependencies (using the `npm install` command).

1. Create the `.env` by using `.env.example` as a reference: `cp .env.example .env`.
2. Update the .env file with your correct local information

- username: `labber`
- password: `labber`
- database: `midterm`

3. Install dependencies: `npm i`
4. Fix to binaries for sass: `npm rebuild node-sass`
5. Reset database: `npm run db:reset`

- Check the db folder to see what gets created and seeded in the SDB

7. Run the server: `npm run local`

- Note: nodemon is used, so you should not have to restart your server

8. Visit `http://localhost:8080/`

## Warnings & Tips

- Do not edit the `layout.css` file directly, it is auto-generated by `layout.scss`
- Split routes into their own resource-based file names, as demonstrated with `users.js` and `widgets.js`
- Split database schema (table definitions) and seeds (inserts) into separate files, one per table. See `db` folder for pre-populated examples.
- Use the `npm run db:reset` command each time there is a change to the database schema or seeds.
  - It runs through each of the files, in order, and executes them against the database.
  - Note: you will lose all newly created (test) data each time this is run, since the schema files will tend to `DROP` the tables and recreate them.
